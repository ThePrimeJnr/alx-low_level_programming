![Hello World in C](https://github.com/DestinedCodes/alx-low_level_programming/assets/84413505/0bd657c6-1376-4960-a42e-42febce786da)

## Welcome to the 0x00. C - Hello, World directory! üåü

This project marks the beginning of the ALX low-level programming curriculum and covers the fundamental concepts of compilation and C programming.

## Project Overview üìö

This directory contains several files, each serving a unique purpose:

1. **0-preprocessor**:
   - This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
   - **Instructions for use**: To preprocess a C file, open your terminal and navigate to the 0x00. C - Hello, World directory. Then, execute the following command:
     ```
     ./0-preprocessor <input_file> <output_file>
     ```
     Replace `<input_file>` with the name of the C file you want to preprocess and `<output_file>` with the name of the file where you want to save the preprocessed output.

2. **1-compiler**:
   - This script compiles a C file but does not link it.
   - **Instructions for use**: To compile a C file without linking, open your terminal and navigate to the 0x00. C - Hello, World directory. Then, execute the following command:
     ```
     ./1-compiler <input_file> -o <output_file>
     ```
     Replace `<input_file>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_file>` with the desired name of the output file (executable).

3. **2-assembler**:
   - This script generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file.
   - **Instructions for use**: To generate the assembly code from a C file, open your terminal and navigate to the 0x00. C - Hello, World directory. Then, execute the following command:
     ```
     ./2-assembler <input_file> -o <output_file>
     ```
     Replace `<input_file>` with the name of the C file you want to convert to assembly and `<output_file>` with the name of the file where you want to save the generated assembly code.

4. **3-name**:
   - This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun".
   - **Instructions for use**: To compile a C file and create an executable named "cisfun", open your terminal and navigate to the 0x00. C - Hello, World directory. Then, execute the following command:
     ```
     ./3-name <input_file> -o cisfun
     ```
     Replace `<input_file>` with the name of the C file you want to compile.

5. **4-puts.c**:
   - A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line.

6. **5-printf.c**:
   - A C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line.

7. **6-size.c**:
   - A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

8. **100-intel**:
   - This script generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file and saves it in an output file.
   - **Instructions for use**: To generate the assembly code (Intel syntax) from a C file, open your terminal and navigate to the 0x00. C - Hello, World directory. Then, execute the following command:
     ```
     ./100-intel <input_file> -o <output_file>
     ```
     Replace `<input_file>` with the name of the C file you want to convert to assembly and `<output_file>` with the name of the file where you want to save the generated assembly code.

9. **101-quote.c**:
   - A C program that prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19" to the standard error.

## Compilation Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

To compile the C programs in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler (such as gcc) installed on your computer.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the 0x00. C - Hello, World directory.

3. Choose the file you want to compile:

   - If it is a script (e.g., 0-preprocessor, 1-compiler, etc.), follow the corresponding instruction provided above for each script.
   
   - If it is a C source code file (e.g., 4-puts.c, 5-printf.c, etc.), use the following commands to compile and run:

     ```
     gcc <filename.c> -o <output_file>
     ```

     ```
     ./<output_file>
     ```

   Replace `<filename.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile, and `<output_file>` with the desired name of the output file (executable).

4. After successful compilation, you will find the output files or executables generated.
